# ðŸŽ¨ Frontend UI Series

A personal frontend challenge to sharpen my HTML & Tailwind CSS skills by turning Figma designs into fully functional web pages.

This project is like my digital sketchbook â€” Iâ€™m coding real-world UI blocks and landing pages, piece by piece, and tracking my progress as I go.

## âœ… What Iâ€™m Practicing

- HTML & semantic structure
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Responsive layouts 
- Clean, readable code
- Git & GitHub Pages deployment
- Project organization & documentation

---

## ðŸ§  Why I'm Doing This

Because practice builds mastery.  
Because I want to make beautiful things with code.

## ðŸ“œ License

Designs are credited to their respective Figma Community creators and are not for commercial use.
